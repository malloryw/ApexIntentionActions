Apex Inention Actions v0.4.3
----------------------------

- Init generation place cursor into init() method
- Plugin usage restricted to apex.source scope only
- "Add overload" action check duplicates by type
- Fixed problem with adding params that start with the same string
- If class extends another one - generated constructor calls super()

Happy coding!
