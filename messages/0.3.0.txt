Apex Inention Actions v0.3.0
----------------------------

Featuring new action: "Add overload" for constructors! ðŸŽ‰

Now you can quickly generate an overload for a constructor with one overloaded parameter - just like for methods.
Use "Alt+Space" on a method with arguments to generate an overloaded method.

No keyboard shortcut is available at this moment.

Also:
1. New way of installation - via Package Control by adding the repo to it.
2. Fixed indentation for method overrides.
3. Slightly changed formatting.

Happy coding!
