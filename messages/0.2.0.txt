Apex Inention Actions v0.2.0
----------------------------

Featuring new action: "Add overload"! ðŸŽ‰

Now you can quickly generate an overload for a method with one overloaded parameter.
Use "Alt+Space" on a method with arguments to generate an overloaded method.

Hot key for the new action is "Ctrl+M, Ctrl+O" ("âŒ˜+M, âŒ˜+O" for Mac).

Happy coding!
