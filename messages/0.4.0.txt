Apex Inention Actions v0.4.0
----------------------------

Featuring new action: "Add { get; set; }" for properties! ðŸŽ‰

Now you can quickly add {get;set;} to any property.

Keyboard shortcut is ["Ctrl+M", "Alt+S"] or ["Ctrl+M", "Alt+G"] (["âŒ˜+M", "Alt+S"] or ["âŒ˜+M", "Alt+G"] on Mac).

- Fixes searching action if method return type or value type includes underscores.
- Fixes "Add overload" key binding.

Happy coding!
